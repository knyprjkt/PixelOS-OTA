- Reduce zram size to 70%
  - We were using 80% which caused an overload on the processor and worsened memory management.
- Update carrier configs from vauxite
- Disable UFFD GC via OVERRIDE_ENABLE_UFFD_GC
- Update power profiles from TKQ1.221114.001-V816.0.11.0.TGKMIXM
- Update some blobs from LA.UM.9.15.2.r1-10600-KAMORTA.QSSI14.0 and LA.QSSI.15.0.r1-14500-qssi.0
- Remove software c2 codec overrides
- Bring back omx avc codec
- Load mixer_paths configs properly
- Update brightness restrictions for VRR

- kgsl: Refactor bus hint/mod
- kgsl: increase HFI timeout
- kgsl: Use kthread instead of workqueue for event work
- spes_defconfig: Drop CONFIG_CPU_BOOST
- spes_defconfig: Use lz4 as zram backend
   - Although zstd offers better compression rates, its decompression is about 3x slower than lz4.
   - Favors system responsiveness over minor gains in compressed memory.
- lz4/crypto/incfs: Use ARM64 v8 ASM to accelerate lz4 decompression
- lz4armv8: Update assembly instructions from Huawei kernel drop
- lz4: Import arm64 V8 ASM lz4 decompression acceleration
- lz4: Import v1.10.0 from upstream
